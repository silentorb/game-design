# Personal Interest

As a player, what do I look for in games?

## Dark fantasy

* My favorite settings are dark fantasy
* Occasionally I play games in other settings for other reasons, but I would always like them more if they were dark fantasy

## Character growth

* I love games with growth
* I love it even more when that growth feels personal

## Creativity

* This usually revolves around composition
  * One of the classic examples being Magic the Gathering's use of combining cards to form a deck

## Optimization

* I love min/maxing
* I have to be careful of this one in particular because it can feed an obssessive side of me that drowns out everything else

## Adventure

* There's an intangible quality to the classic D&D notion of gathering a party of adventurers and setting out into the wild unknown
* I have a romantic nostalgia that keeps pulling me back to that

## Strategy

* I love planning ahead, though mostly at a high level, not planning out the details
* I quickly grow tired of chess-like planning ahead of precise moves and contingencies
* I like fuzzier strategy where there are more unknowns and it is less practical to quantify the possible outcomes

## Consideration

* In general, I don't like being rushed in games
* I play a lot of action games and have fairly quick reaction speeds, but at the end of the day I prefer pondering than knee-jerk reactions

## Exploration

* Exploration is not my favorite part of games or a quality I actively seek out, yet more and more I'm realizing that is a subtle but important element to what I like in games
* I think part of the problem is often exploration is done poorly, and I don't like poor exploration, and sometimes I throw out the baby with the bath water

## Different perspectives with seamless transitions

* This is one of the main reasons I love 3D, is the ability to see things from different perspectives
* My favorite example of this is Dark Souls, where you see a castle in the distance, and later you end up at that castle, looking back at your previous vantage point
* Being seamless is also important here—simply being able to teleport to that other location or doing so in turns wouldn't have the same effect
  * Being seamless increases the sense of wonder—the surprise at how following a continuous and unbroken thread can result in such a radically different place

## Dynamic Worlds

* I like games where you revisit previous locations and things have changed, or levels that mutate over the course of a playthrough
  * Some DOOM maps are amazing at this
  * BioShock 3 does this in a hamfisted manner that I don't care for at all
* MineCraft has extremely dynamic maps, but it is so dynamic that the dynamic nature is somewhat cheapened
  * In most games with dynamic environments, its a *surprise* when the environment changes

## Immersive

* Being immersive is not as important to me as some, but it is still important
* I'm not into VR or AR
* I am happy with 3D first person realtime games on a tradtional desktop PC

## Beauty

* I want the game to have beautiful art
* The art doesn't need to be high fidelity or AAA quality
* Instead, the art needs to be well-designed, aesthetically pleasing, and fresh

## Sense of story

* I don't need an elaborate plot, but I do need a sense of story

## Dense content

* I'm more of a quality over quantity person
* I don't like it when things are spread out
* I like locations crammed with things to do
* Density is my art style in general—I tend to make art that doesn't have a lot of detail but the details are crammed together

## Interactive

* While I was mixed about this direction in the 90s, in recent years I've increasingly become fascinated by Build-engine interactivity
* Fitting with the dense content idea, I like the idea of a world where the player can walk into a room and interact with things all over that room

## Structure

* I've never been a fan of sandboxes
  * My outlet for that degree of creativity is making things from scratch, not within an existing game
* I prefer well defined goals and achievement

## Permadeath

* I would rather start over with a clean slate than need to rely on save-scumming, checkpoints, or grinding

## Short playthroughs

* With permadeath in mind, I don't like having massive amounts of investment that can get lost in a moment
  * As I've probably written about in other places, that actually reduces the challenge, forcing players to turtle and avoid danger
* I prefer to fail fast

## Unique playthroughs

* I dislike static, scripted scenarios
* I don't like it when games reward/punish you based on your knowledge of upcoming terrain
  * The one exception to this is competitive games like Paladins where the maps are reocurring arenas, then knowledge of the map is more general than specific
* Part of why I prefer unique playthroughs is because I prefer rewarding general over specific knowledge, and unique playthroughs reward general knowledge

## Persistence

* Within a playthrough, I've rarely been a fan of journey's being broken up into discreet areas with no back-tracking
* Persistence ties in with the increasingly popular design notion of "choices matter"—persistence gives decisions longer-term consequences
  * So many games revolve around decisions that don't have significant impact beyond the next few minutes

## Local Co-Op

* Playing games with my sons
  * In some ways this conflicts with the rest of my game goals but at the same time games usually only have to sacrifice fringe features in order to support decent local co-op.

## Challenge

* Paladins is one of the games few games where I'll play the same basic scenario over and over again because every time feels like a fresh challenge

## Complexity

* Rewarding investment

## Cozy

* I love it when games have a sense of coziness
* Unfortunately, that is rarely packaged with the other things I look for in games, though I think that is slowly changing

## Surrealism

* This is sort of a sub-category under dark fantasy, but I love surreal settings and level design

## Open-ended

* I don't like wrote, single-solution challenges
* I prefer games to have problems with multiple possible solutions
* This ties in with the creativity item

## Indirect agency

* I don't like micromanagement
* I like make sweeping decisions and letting the game sort out the details

## Pacifism

* I mostly play fighting games, but that's only because so many of the things I am looking for are only packaged with fighting
* When possible, I usually gravitate toward pacifism
  * I always liked how the first episode of Heretic was more about dodging than shooting, and most of the game could be completed simply via agility
  * When playing immersive sims, I usually focus on stealth and non-lethal means

## Spiritually Edifying

* I rarely play games that are spiritually edifying, but if there was a game that had many of these attributes and was spiritually edifying, it would be one of my favorite games
