## Boiled down idea

* Make a game where players needs to help their enemies
* Simplest approachâ€”no allies, only enemies
* The player needs some incentive to help enemies

## Champions and beasts

* Distinctive characters (champions) and generic characters (beasts)
* Beasts have:
  * Simpler AI state and are less relational
  * Uniform appearance
* Champions"
  * Have more complex AI state
  * Each champion is unique
  * Each champion has a distinctive appearance
* 



## Spatiality

* Most or all state is visually represented in 3D space
* Most or all state changes are visually represented in 3D space
* At least some of the visuals feel creative, as though the player is creating a work of art by causing certain effects
* Atomic, modal actors
