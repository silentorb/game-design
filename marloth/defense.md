# Defensive Gameplay

## Motivation

* I've always enjoyed passive, defensive gameplay
  * This is probably due in part to
    * My being more reactive than proactive
    * Defense usually involves some form of general preparation/investment in the future
* I've been trying to convert the TWOLD narrative to gameplay for years
* The core element to convert is family provision
* I've been seeing family provision as a form of survival
* Most survival games I'm familiar with revolve around resource gathering and crafting
  * Two game mechanics that have never interested me

## Tower Defense

* The most common defense game is tower defense
* But I don't really want to make a tower defense game
* I like the idea of placing some towers, but I don't want the game to be all about towers
* Neither do I want the game to be all about busy work like some tower defense games mix in
* Nor do I want to the game to be about hordes of enemies
  * I don't want the game to escalate into raw mechanics like most tower defense games do

## Dungeon Defenders

* Oddly, I don't think of Dungeon Defenders much when I think of tower defense
* Part of that is there are so many things I don't like about Dungeon Defender's design
* However, Dungeon Defenders is a great example of a real-time, third-person defense game and possibly the best jumping board for me to build from
* Bringing up Dungeon Defenders begs the question "What about Orcs Must Die?"
  * I've never liked Orcs Must Die as much, though most of my play of Dungeon Defenders has been local co-op, something Orcs Must Die didn't support, so that may be the biggest issue
  * Orcs Must Die is less of an RPG
  * I prefer the art and atmosphere of Dungeon Defenders
  * Orcs Must Die puts a little more weight on player combat, which I find boring in both games

## The Idea

* What if I combined what I always loved about AOS maps and some other WC3 defense maps where an existing battle is going on and the player is simply trying to shift the tide of battle?
* Instead of placing towers as the primary defense, what if defenses were already established and the player is trying to enhance and maintain what is already in place?
  * My main inspiration for this is Grim Dawn, where the towns have barricades manned by AI units that pick off random lesser monsters that are periodically spawned to throw themselves at the entryways
    * These set pieces are practically static and the player never directly interacts with them, but its still enough to paint the picture for the scenario
* Tying back to one of my earlier simulation game ideas, the emphasis would be on entropyâ€”the situation is slowly decaying and the player is simply trying to hold back the decay for a certain period of time
* This would allow one of the most seamless paths I've had yet to multi-domain
  * The offense/defense could be purely combat-oriented for MVP
  * In later versions additional dependencies could be introduced with attacks on those dependencies
    * For example, food and nourishment could be introduced, with certain kinds of attacks that do not perform perform combat damage but instead destroy food, causing people to starve
* Similar to Dungeon Defenders, different waves could come from different directions, shifting focus from one part of the map to another, introducing some incentive for the player to move around and making the locations less stale
* Instead of defending crystals, the player would defend people
* In later versions some degree of offense could be introduced as well, such as assaulting a fortress that is spawning endless waves of enemies
