# Inspiration Contrast

## Overview

* There are no games that are similar to the game I want to make
* That's not a good thing
* This document is an attempt to isolate the differences between the games closest to what I want to make and the game I want to make
* There are some games that are in many ways closer mechanics-wise but are not immersive 3D games (real time first or third person), which rules them out
  * I'm only interested in creating an immersive 3D game and have found that it is too big of a gap to act as a starting point
    * In other words, I need to start with an immersive 3D game and port over elements from more abstract games, as opposed to starting with a more abstract game and trying to convert it to an immersive 3D game


## Closest Games

* Alan Wake
* Dark Souls
* Alice: Madness Returns
* Dishonored
* The Witcher 3
* DOOM 2

## Game Notes

### Alan Wake

* Even though it fails so many of the criteria, it works so well as an interactive story that looking at the data this way makes me rethink whether or not I could make a game with stripped down mechanics and focus on setting and story

### Dark Souls

* Mechanics-wise, this is the closest game to what I am trying to make
* It's stretching things a little to say it can support a practical MVP, but the Souls-like formula has been taken so many directions I think the core essence has been well formalized and proven to be fairly minimal

### Alice: Madness Returns

* Even though Alice 2 fails every criteria in this survey, it's still worth including because at a glance it looks like there's a lot of similarities and is worth clarifying

### Dishonored

* Matches a lot of the criteria but fails an essential onesâ€”a practical MVP
* Dishonored works because it is inefficientâ€”it guzzles resources but has a lot of resources to guzzle

### The Witcher 3

* Similar to Dishonored, the Witcher 3 does not have a minimal core and instead relies on quantity of content and systems

### DOOM II

* The most straightforward and efficient core gameplay with few frills
* Some great DOOM II Wads are single map but unfortunately I've never liked those as muchâ€”DOOM shines the most when it has map progression
