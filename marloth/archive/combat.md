# Combat

## Tactical Combat

### Ideas

* What if there were no traditional spatial attacksâ€”instead all attacks were spells that directly affected the target and could not be dodged?

### Mobility

* One of the single biggest challenges with real time 3D combat is mobility

### DOOM 2016

* DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal revolutionized action games
* One of the major innovations was increasing player mobility

### Current Issues

* Mobility makes melee attacks useless
* Either melee attacks need to be nearly instantaneous (which causes other problems)
