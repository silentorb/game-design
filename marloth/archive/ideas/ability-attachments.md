# Ability Attachments

## Motivation

* The primary motivation is to have different triggers on abilities

* I like the idea of each upgrade having a type and zero or more attached modifiers
* However, that attachment system could quickly become too complicated
* There are probably a few different ways I could constrain the system to make it simpler

## Non-Orthogonal

One problem is that base abilities and attachments are non-orthogonal.

Possible solutions:

1. Any ability can be a root or an attachment, they just work differently in each position

2. Root abilities have random attachments and when a player acquires two root abilities of the same type they merge into one ability with their attachments merged as well
