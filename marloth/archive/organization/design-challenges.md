## Design Challenges

### Integrating Unrelated Domains

### Restricting Movement

### Non-Spatial Domains

### Realtime Discourages Decision Making

### Limited UI

* UI is always one of the main bottlenecks with games
* For a 3D game, abstract UI is extra challenging

### Tamed Growth

* Growth is one of my favorite part of games
* Growth is one of the most difficult aspects to tame
* Most games balance growth by crippling it and making it almost an illusion

### Tamed Randomness

* I want variety of encounters, but randomness has always bitten me
* Randomness is a two-edged sword

### Scaling Player Count

* I'd like this game to work both as single player and multiplayer

### Non-Spatial Progress

* Spatial progress—a term I just made up to represent victory being tied to the player getting to a particular location
* Most of my Marloth games have been trying to avoid or minimize spatial progress—having a world where the player hangs out instead of tries to just get past—but that has never worked out great

### Simple Foundation

* Is it is even possible for all of the above criteria to be met with a simple foundation?
  * If not, I've got to scale back my expectations
