# Indirect Agency

* I love the Peter Molyneux approach to indirect player agency, and that feels like a good fit for this game
* However, that approach is also a two edged sword that has usually turned Molyneux games into novelties that are revered more for their ideas than their results
  * The classic example is Dungeon Keeper: even though it is one of the ultimate "high concept" video games, it is really clunky and I've rarely enjoyed actually *playing* it
* If I did go with indirect player agency, how would that work?
  * As is so often the case, I don't have a precedent for this in a third-person game—most games with indirect player agency are god games
* Other games with Indirect Agency like Dungeon Keeper fall back on micromanagement
  * I don't know why
  * I can try to not fall back on micromanagement and see what happens

## Walking Simulator

* Walking simulators are actually kind of close to what I'm looking for
* Except instead of having a linear path, I want an open world simulation the player can explore


## WarCraft III

* WarCraft III hero siege and AOS maps are the only good example I can think of defense being a versital foundation for many different player activities (and those custom maps are a very good example)
  * I've often found it surprising that WarCraft III hero siege maps haven't been a bigger influence
    * I have seen some games in the genre but none successful
    * This is in contrast to WarCraft III's influence on RTS, tower defense, Moba, and arena battles

### Extracting Lessons from Hero Defense Maps

* Note: I would use the term "Hero Siege" here except now when I hear that phrase all I think about is that stupid game by the same name
  * that game actually started out as sort of a WarCraft III defense game and switched to being a Diablo II Rogue-lite
  * Hey, I guess that is another example of a game that successfully pivoted, though that wasn't so much an extension (adding new domains alongside the MVP domain) as much as a massive retooling of the core gameplay
    * In other words, they didn't simply adjust course: they backed up
* Players interact with the WarCraft III hero defense maps in the following ways:

#### Hero Placement

* Moving their hero around and having their hero fight
* This worked particularly well because the hero would have partial AI and would engage in battle on their own
* It was nice how the player could give micro-managing controls when they wanted to but by default they could rely on general automation
  * This is similar to the design I've always admired so much about Magic the Gathering, where each turn has so many phases that are normally implicitly skipped but are there when players need them

#### Placing Towers

* Mostly this was in tower-defense-focused maps, but I think there were one or more defense maps that sported tower placement as a supporting feature

#### Hiring Troops

* This wasn't very common, but some hero defense maps had this feature
* It helped mix things up and was easy to implement since it was the default mechanic for WarCraft III, but fit as well in game
  * At least not without a sophisticated UI to manage the troops
  * Off the top of my head I can't think of a first/third person 3D game that pulled off managing NPCs well—I feel like all of my experiences of this were unpleasant

#### Upgrading Defenses

* This is fairly common in hero defense maps
* This usually involved upgrading towers and upgrading barracks
  * The barracks would be periodically spawning new defensive troops
  * The towers would usually be built into the map and not player placed

#### Casting area spells

* Some of the maps like one of the AOS MTG maps featured occasional spell casting such as periodically being able to drop a nuke anywhere on the map
  * Being able to do so was an investment decision—the player did not immediately have this ability and had to choose to invest in such spells instead of other avenues
