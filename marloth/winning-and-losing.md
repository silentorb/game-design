# Winning and Losing

## Notable Win Condition Cases

* Winning and losing is a spectrum

### Campaign

* Winning and losing is boolean

### Sandbox

* There is no winning and losing
* Players can invent their own goals, but those goals are not game enforced

### Achievements

* Sub-goals 

### Different Win Conditions

* Different players have different win conditions
* Two most common forms are:

  * Random objective games (usually strategy board games)

## Alternative Hybrid

* Is it possible to have a game with multiple win and loss conditions per-player?
