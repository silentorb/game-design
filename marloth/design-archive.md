# Design Achive

## Tasks

* Determine whether a defense-focused game could solve many of my current design woes
  * Keeping in mind that my closest inspirations are not defensive but offensive

## Challenges

### Simple AI

* AI can get complicated and require a lot of work and maintenance
  * I enjoy working on complex AI but for the sake of the project I need to keep the AI stupid simple, at least for MVP
* How can the AI be kept simple?

#### Resolution

* I've gotten a better handle on the Unreal AI and it looks like I can practically rely on that as a core aspect of gameplay and put more weight on it

## Design Questions

### What is the Primary Activity?

* Can I say pseudo-fighting? (Treating non-combat domains like they are combat?)
