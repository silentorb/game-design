## Marloth RPG Elements Design

## RPG Definition

For the purpose of these documents, I am using the term RPG as a subset of what I would consider a Role Playing Game to be.

The subset here includes:

1. Character customization
2. Character abilities
3. Character growth
4. Character disadvantages

## Passive Abilities

* I like the idea of exclusively using passive/auto abilities and no activated abilities
* Most abilities would still have an activity but activation would be triggered by certain circumstances
* Different triggers could be attached to abilities that specified the circumstances

* This is both a way of leverage a design pattern I like to call Molineux agency, or indirect agency: having the player interact with the world indirectly instead of directly
  * This has gained in popularity with games like Vampire Survivor

## Disadvantages

* Partially inspired by GURPS, I've always liked the idea of putting as much weight on negative character traits as positive character traits
  * When I played GURPS with friends and families, the players actually enjoyed selecting the disadvantages *more* than the advantages
* Disadvantages fit particularly well in survival horror games and have been increasingly featured in recent games
* Some notable games where player characters can accumulate disadvantages:
  * Mordheim
  * Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
  * Darkest Dungeon
* Rogue Legacy also prominently features disadvantages though they are only auto-assigned during character creation, not acquired over the course of play
* I've toyed around with idea in the past of having characters age and get slowly weaker over the course of a playthrough—I wasn't completely sold on the idea when it was a simple stat loss (gradual decline in max health, speed, etc.) but endlessly accumulated disadvantages sounds more interesting (I may have thought about that before but the foundation of my designs did not support the idea as well as the current foundation.)
  * Part of the motivation for this is the market currently has more than enough power fantasies and I like the idea of anti-power fantasies, which again is more inline with survival horror
    * Part of this motivation is also because I think excessive power fantasizing is unhealthy and is subtly warping cultural values
* All that to say, with the combination of disadvantages and an [intrinsic world](#intrinsic-world), potentially most or all of the scaling difficulty of the game could be simply through disadvantage accumulation
  * The world doesn't get more dangerous, the player traits effectively cause the player to be more dangerous
* It's like suddenly acquiring a lethal allergy to peanuts—items that at one time provided nourishment are now deadly obstacles to be avoided

## Intrinsic World

* I've had this idea before, but what if most of the threats and change in the world was not dictated by external elements, but the characters own development?
* The original idea for this was to give players a potential negative abilities that cause increased of specific types of monsters to spawn in each new level
* Now I have ideas on how to run much farther with that direction, where intrinsic features could dictate how game entities are threats
* It might even work to initially have no threats, and as each player progresses through the world they acquire negative features that result in existing entities effectively becoming threats
  * For example, having a disadvantage that causes certain creature types to attack the player
  * It's like instead of the enemies having the abilities, the player has the abilities that cause the enemies to hurt them—it's like the enemies aren't entirely the responsible parties
* Part of the motivation for this is I'm an introvert and I prefer intrinsic features over extrinsic features
  * This direction opens up the possibility to increase how many of the game mechanics are intrinsic
* This idea also aligns with the first Marloth book and similar narratives where the world is partially a manifestation of the protagonist's personality and inner struggles
* Focusing on intrinsic abilities should also add more opportunity for spiritual elements
* Focusing on intrinsic abilities should also leave more room for a multi-domain world, where enemies

## Dual Layer Ability System

* This automatic, intrinsic system could use two layers
  * The first layer would be the existing ability system
  * The second layer would be the trigger system, which could be equally as complex as the ability system

## Player Control

* The primary design questions for this ability approach would be:
  * How much control the player would have in selecting abilities?
  * If the player has limited control, what parts of the system does the player have control over?
  * How is gaining and customizing abilities integrated into the rest of the gameplay and game world?
  * How complex should the ability composition be?
