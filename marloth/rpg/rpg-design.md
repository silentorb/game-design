## Marloth RPG Elements Design

## RPG Definition

For the purpose of these documents, I am using the term RPG as a subset of what I would consider a Role Playing Game to be.

The subset here includes:

1. Character customization
2. Character abilities
3. Character growth
4. Character disadvantages

## Character Classes

* [Context](./rpg-context.md#character-classes)

* I would like to have a class-based system without levels
* I'm open to having some shared features between classes

## Passive Abilities

* I like the idea of exclusively using passive/auto abilities and no activated abilities
* Most abilities would still have an activity but activation would be triggered by certain circumstances
* Different triggers could be attached to abilities that specified the circumstances

* This is both a way of leverage a design pattern I like to call Molineux agency, or indirect agency: having the player interact with the world indirectly instead of directly
  * This has gained in popularity with games like Vampire Survivor

## Disadvantages

* Partially inspired by GURPS, I've always liked the idea of putting as much weight on negative character traits as positive character traits
  * When I played GURPS with friends and families, the players actually enjoyed selecting the disadvantages *more* than the advantages

### Details	

* It's like suddenly acquiring a lethal allergy to peanuts—items that at one time provided nourishment are now deadly obstacles to be avoided
* I also like the idea of abilities that have both an advantage and a disadvantage

## Intrinsic World

* I've had this idea before, but what if most of the threats and change in the world was not dictated by external elements, but the characters own development?
* The original idea for this was to give players a potential negative abilities that cause increased or specific types of monsters to spawn in each new level
* Now I have ideas on how to run much farther with that direction, where intrinsic features could dictate how game entities are threats
* It might even work to initially have no threats, and as each player progresses through the world they acquire negative features that result in existing entities effectively becoming threats
  * For example, having a disadvantage that causes certain creature types to attack the player
  * It's like instead of the enemies having the abilities, the player has the abilities that cause the enemies to hurt them—it's like the enemies aren't entirely the responsible parties

## Dual Layer Ability System

* This automatic, intrinsic system could use two layers
  * The first layer would be the existing ability system
  * The second layer would be the trigger system, which could be equally as complex as the ability system

## Design Questions

The primary design questions for this ability approach are:
* How much control would the player have in selecting abilities?
* If the player has limited control, what parts of the system does the player have control over?
* How do players acquire abilities?
* How do players acquire disadvantages?
* How complex should the ability composition be?

## Disadvantage Acquisition

How do players acquire disadvantages?

* I could have players periodically choose disadvantages
  * This has the following downsides:
    * A player could consistently only choose certain disadvantages, which isn't terrible but feels off
      * Players have less incentive to explore disadvantages than they do advantages
    * Rogue-lite disadvantage selection does not have the fun factor that selecting disadvantages did with GURPS because it was all before the gameplay started and didn't feel as life and death as choosing a disadvantage while in the middle of trying to survive
  * I want at least some of the disadvantages to represent vices, and it's wrong to have players actively choosing their vices
* It would probably work better at both a thematic and gameplay level for disadvantage acquisition to be influence by player actions
  * For example, having a creature type that, when visible on screen long enough over time, would give the player a disadvantage relating to that creature type
* I like the idea of having numeric disadvantage accumulators during an outing, and then when the player sleeps those accumulators are applied and translated to the acquisition of actual disadvantages which are presented to the player via a UI screen
  * You've gained a new [disadvantage]!

## Variations

Here is a list of primary variations and cross options I can think of for this system:
