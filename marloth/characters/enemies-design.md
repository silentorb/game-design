### Things to Avoid

* This character should be visually attractive but should not be a stumbling block
* I don't want to go the siren direction
  * In particular, I don't want this character to:
    * Have any marine themes
    * Have a blue or aqua color scheme
    * Use her voice as a weapon (I want sight to be the primary weapon)
    * Be transparent or ghostlike (sometimes siren types are)
* I don't want Medusa either
  * While some abilities will be determined by whether the player is in this character's sight, the main theme is whether this character is in the *player's sight*
  * In particular, I don't want this character to:
    * Have snake hair
    * Turn the player to stone
      * There's something about partially restricted motion that better fits the seductress theme
* If tendrils are used, I don't want the character to be full blown Lovecraftian
  * This character should be mysterious, but not *that* alien
  * Part of the theme is being both mysterious and yet comfortably familiar—someone players can feel safe with even though they shouldn't

### Notes

* This character has few ways of directly injuring the player but can adversely manipulate the player and can be devastating when grouped with other enemies
