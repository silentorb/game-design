# Marloth Enemies Context

Context for [Enemies Design](./enemies-design.md).

## Enemy design requirements

### Requirements

The enemies should be:

1. Thematic
2. Distinct
3. Spiritually synergetic
4. Foster good game mechanics
5. Robust
6. Have lots of notable visual detail
7. Surreal and minimally anthropomorphic

### Notes

#### Thematic

* Each enemy should have multiple themes
* Each enemy should have at least one ordinary, everyday theme

#### Distinct

* This includes being visually distinct both in visual profile and color for easy cognition

#### Surreal and minimally anthropomorphic

* Part of this is a production motivation—making less human characters will simply development efforts
  * In particular, the further away from humanity, the further away from the strict expectations people have for human appearance and motion
  * The one downside is this will minimize sharing the same rigs and animations, but I'm increasingly running into downsides with that approach so specialized skeletons and animations isn't looking so bad now
* The other issue is I like the idea of these enemies being cursed and deformed

## Primary enemies from a game mechanic perspective

1. Stationary ranged
2. Roaming melee
3. Stationary immobilizing

## Enemy themes

### Primary

1. Seductress
2. Beast
3. Plant
4. Wretched abomination
5. Chained down

#### Secondary

1. Miser / money
2. Spoiled brat
3. Aggressively fearful
4. Ghost
5. Lovecraftian horror beyond the void
6. Skeleton / skulls
7. Disease / poison

## Enemies

### Seductress

> :bulb: Stationary immobilizing

#### Gender

* Female

#### Themes

##### Primary

* Beauty / Grace / Charm
* Sight / Vision / Visage
* Dance / Rhythm / Writhing / Deformation
* Insidious / Corrupt
* Manipulation / Restriction

* Fire / Flames / Ash
* Tendrils

#### Possible Colors

* Yellow
* Orange
* Red
* Purple
* Black

#### Things to Avoid

* This character should be visually attractive but should not be a stumbling block
* I don't want to go the siren direction
  * In particular, I don't want this character to:
    * Have any marine themes
    * Have a blue or aqua color scheme
    * Use her voice as a weapon (I want sight to be the primary weapon)
    * Be transparent or ghostlike (sometimes siren types are)
* I don't want Medusa either
  * While some abilities will be determined by whether the player is in this character's sight, the main theme is whether this character is in the *player's sight*
  * In particular, I don't want this character to:
    * Have snake hair
    * Turn the player to stone
      * There's something about partially restricted motion that better fits the seductress theme
* If tendrils are used, I don't want the character to be full blown Lovecraftian
  * This character should be mysterious, but not *that* alien
  * Part of the theme is being both mysterious and yet comfortably familiar—someone players can feel safe with even though they shouldn't

#### Notes

* This character has few ways of directly injuring the player but can adversely manipulate the player and can be devastating when grouped with other enemies
