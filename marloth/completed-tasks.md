# Completed Design Tasks

### Solidify Practical MVP

* Start with what you know—you're favorite games that are closest to what you want to make—and draw a straight line from them to where you've been trying to go
* The main goal is to establish a perspective to give a more objective and precise stock of what design goals are tripping me up the most and what may need to get cut for this project to be realistic

### Player Location and Travel

* Either:
  * The primary objectives are location-based or
  * I need to come up with a well-defined system for the significance of player location and motivation for the player to change location
* One way or the other, I need to really formalize how important spatial objectives are to traditional FPS games to more accurately measure the cost of not having one

### Minimal Fighting

* This has been a major stumbling block for years
* This needs to be either solidified or cut
