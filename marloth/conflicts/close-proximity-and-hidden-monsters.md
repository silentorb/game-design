# Close proximity and hidden monsters

I would like to have a sense of mystery and fear with the possibilities of monsters being somewhere out there, which is easier to achieve with a large world, and harder to achieve with a small, intimate world.

I'm not saying there's no way to achieve both of those together, but most solutions for that are probably more complicated than simply, "You're safe right now because the monsters must be far away".
