# Primary Activities

## What are the Primary Activities?

### Summary

1. Navigation
2. Exploration
3. Avoiding dangers
4. Gathering resources
5. Observation
6. Interacting with environment

### Navigation

* At first glance, navigating around a 3D world sounds boring
* Yet that is one of the primary actions of a first person shooter, and when I think about it, if the environment is interesting then I do enjoy walking around it
* This is in part how walking simulators have become a viable genre
* Some games, particularly third-person action games, make navigation very involved and elaborate
* I want to keep navigation simple, but squeeze every ounce of significance from it
* There is a danger that navigation as a primary activity may prove boring for me and I'll lose interest, but I think this is going to work
* I've been fighting against this for years, and yet at the end of the day one of my biggest drives is to make a cool 3D world and how I love seeing 3D worlds from different angles, why wouldn't moving around that world be important?

### Exploration

* Exploration isn't normally something I look for in a game
* Yet I've avoided hand crafted maps and repeatedly gravitated toward procedurally generated maps
* Occasionally in a game I will get into exploration
  * Playing Minecraft is probably when I've enjoyed exploration the most
    * It would be worth listing other games that piqued my exploration interest

### Avoiding dangers

* Out of all of the primary activities, this is the one that immediately interests me the most
* I love engaging enemies in non-lethal, indirect means, and I feel like action games focus too much on permanently destroying threats instead of surviving them
* Indirect solutions also lend themselves better to tactics and strategy
  * When a game is about promptly killing everything in sight, threats become short term problems with little long-term impact beyond the question of how much player ammo and health they drained

### Gathering Resources

* This is something I never look for in games and rarely enjoyâ€”I'm not a hunter/gatherer
* However, resource gathering keeps coming back as a perfect ingredient for rounding out this recipe
* Once again, maybe I can isolate the games with resource gathering which I enjoyed the most, and see if there are ways I can make the resource gathering more fun for someone like me
* It might help a little if the resources are finite, unlike many survival games where resources replenish infinitely and gathering becomes a fallback grind, similar to the way some RPGs fall back on level grinding

### Observation

* In order for observation to be meaningful for gameplay, the player must face choices that depend on questions which can only be answered through observation
* 

### Interacting with environment

* Specifically, particular game elements supporting the player interacting with them when facing them and pressing an interaction button
* By default these would contain immediate effects and some of them could involve a GUI menu
*
