# Defensive Gameplay

## Motivation

* I've always enjoyed passive, defensive gameplay
  * This is probably due in part to
    * My being more reactive than proactive
    * Defense usually involves some form of general preparation/investment in the future
* I've been trying to convert the TWOLD narrative to gameplay for years
* The core element to convert is family provision
* I've been seeing family provision as a form of survival
* Most survival games I'm familiar with revolve around resource gathering and crafting
  * Two game mechanics that have never interested me

## Tower Defense

* The most common defense game is tower defense
* But I don't really want to make a tower defense game
* I like the idea of placing some towers, but I don't want the game to be all about towers
* Neither do I want the game to be all about busy work like some tower defense games mix in
* Nor do I want to the game to be about hordes of enemies
  * I don't want the game to escalate into raw mechanics like most tower defense games do
