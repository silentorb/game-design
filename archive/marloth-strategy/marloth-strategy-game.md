# Marloth Strategy Game

Design Document

## Overview

This is an experimental scoping for what it would be like to have a Marloth game that was turn-based and non-spatial.

## Background

* Based on my old Heroes Realm game from the late 90s
* Represent spatial reality in an abstract formâ€”spatial entities are located in different parts of the world but the relationship between those different locations are fuzzy
* The player travels through a wilderness and randomly attempts to arrive at particular locations
