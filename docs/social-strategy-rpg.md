# Social Strategy RPG

## Problems

* How to make a game revolving around dialog choices where:
  * Choices matter
  * Losing is measurable/numeric
  * State and options are generalized (as opposed to being a predefined graph)
  * The player is well-informed (not just guessing at what will happen when certain dialog options are selected)
  * Strategy is rewarded

## Solutions

### Choices Matter

* Every choice needs a price
  * Maybe most choices need composite prices
* Most prices should be communicated to the player
  * Maybe all prices should be communicated to the player
* Price communication should be communicated both at the moment of decision and in the future

### Measurable Winning/Loss

* Quantifiable
* Users can see reports of how close they are to permanent winning or losing
* Fungible integration
* Like when your HP reaches zero in combat)
* Not every aspect of losing has to be quantifiable, but its helpful to have some foundational metrics
* Quantifiable winning can be high-level and does not need to be precise
  * Such as games where a player has to complete a collection of tasks of roughly the same size and can have a sense of "Oh, I've completed half of the tasks so I must be half way through"



### Player Information

* The player needs to have more social information available than RPGs normally provide
* Maybe a UI view of the character's mind, containing multiple tabs and many reports
* The player should see primarily current state
  * But also some historical data
  * And possibly even some projections of potential future data
* Maybe the views available would be related to the character's attributes
  * Characters with better memory will see more historical data
    * And immediate data as well (memory is required for current data)
  * Characters with a more strategic intellect will be able to generate projection reports
  * Maybe the character could be an unreliable witness in some cases, and the player will not be sure how far to trust the character's mind
*
