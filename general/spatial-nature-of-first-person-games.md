# The Spatial Nature of First Person Games

Why is it that first person games are almost synonymous with shooting?  Is it that people just like violence?

No.  Violence is popular, but not that popular.  Often violence in video games is a fall back not because people crave violence, but because violence just works. (How violence translates to effective game design is worth its own article...)

In the case of first person games, shooting things is simply the most efficient means of creating engaging gameplay within a real-time 3D world.

First person, real-time 3D games are the most tangible form of video game.  They have regularly been associated with immersion, and for good reasonâ€”they most closely model real world physical experience.

That also means first person 3D is the poorest video game medium for abstraction.

id software pioneered the genre of pure first person shooters.  In particular, their 3D games from Catacomb 3D through Quake 3 are some of the best examples of first person shooters that focus on natural 3D spatial mechanics.

Most first person games inject abstract mechanics into the 3D experience.  This opens up a lot of feature opportunities, but it also creates a lot of seams game designers need to hide.

One of the games to see the greatest leveraging of the fundamental elements of an FPS is DOOM II. through its decades of map making communities.  The DOOM mapping scene has refined level design to a degree not seen in most gaming.
