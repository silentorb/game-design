# Marloth Game Engine Timeline

By Christopher W. Johnson

## Background

The Marloth game has bounced around between several different game engines.  Below is a timeline of which engines were used and roughly when.

An important piece of context for this timeline: the bar for game tech is far lower than it is for the rest of the software industry.  Most senior developers who work in other software domains such as web are horrified when they see how things are done in the game industry.

Dedicated game developers become numb to the friction.  It's hard to maintain that numbness when straddling industries and being regularly reminded how much better things can be.

One other note, this is not a comprehensive timeline of my game development experience.  I started game programming around 1991, mostly creating my own game engines until 2011, and over the course of this timeline I worked on many other games and used additional game engines not listed here.

## The Timeline

| Year        | Engine                         | Motivation                                                   | Notes                                                        | Progress                                                     | Reasons for Leaving                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2011        | Unreal Engine 3                | I was a big fan of the Unreal Tournament series, had dabbled with the previous UE engines, and love the UE3 look. |                                                              | Didn't get very far with this.                               | Barebones tooling, less than minimal documentation, and a focus on static/baked everything where I wanted to make a procedurally generated world |
| 2012        | MonoGame                       | I had dabbled with XNA when it first came out (and its precursor I don't remember the name of) and was still partially a Microsoft man at this point. |                                                              | Simple world generation.                                     | MonoGame was great but it's features were skeletal and it was painful to watch the maintainers demolish the elegant XNA architecture Microsoft had built.  I didn't have much faith in MonoGame's future, and rightly so. |
| 2012        | Unity 3                        | Unity was rising in popularity and the next best option.     |                                                              | Simple world generation.                                     | Was frustrated by Unity being designed for amateur developers instead of professionals |
| 2012 - 2014 | NeoAxis                        | NeoAxis did a good job putting weight on existing open source libraries and mostly providing the glue. | Ogre3D was the primary foundation for NeoAxis.               | The first alpha version of Marloth was created with this.  ([Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjOSU_EXq4).) | NeoAxis will never be a serious game engine and I finally had to leave it.  I was spending more time hacking around its bugs and limitations than making a game. |
| 2014        | Custom Game Engine - Ogre3D    | I had made custom game engines in the past but had been trying to avoid that with Marloth.  After NeoAxis I decided to use the same open source libraries it used and build a more elegant architecture around them. | Similar to Unity and NeoAxis, I created a C# layer on top of a C++ layer.  I also made a custom programming language to go with this engine. | Advanced world generation ported from the NeoAxis version.   | The primary maintainer of Ogre3D left and the community was split between two incompatible versions.  During the Torchlight years Ogre3D had potential but it never reached critical mass and permanently lost its momentum. |
| 2016        | Custom Game Engine - C++       | I hadn't created a game engine from scratch in 15 years, but finally gave it a try | This game engine was used for a 3D sci-fi strategy game that was never published.  I made a second custom programming language to go with this engine. | Advanced world generation using a new algorithm              | For a one-man team, writing everything in C++ was adding significant overhead and maintaining a dual language system wouldn't have saved enough time. |
| 2017        | Custom Game Engine - Kotlin    | Kotlin is my favorite programming language but there aren't any professional-grade engines that support it.  So I made one. | The initial version of this engine was basically a port of the C++ version. | Created the second alpha version of the game (no demo available.) | Like everyone warns, I often found myself spending more time on the engine than the game. |
| 2017        | Unity 2017                     | I was ready to give Unity another try.                       |                                                              | Didn't get very far.                                         | Most of the earlier Unity problems I had run into were still present. |
| 2018        | Unreal Engine 4                | I was ready to give Unreal another try.                      | Was much more accessible than UE3                            | Created several test scenarios with AI combat.               | Continuing focus on static everything, incredibly brittle workflows, and painfully slow C++ development. |
| 2018 - 2021 | Custom Game Engine - Kotlin    | Returned to my Kotlin game engine.                           | I made a third custom programming language to go with this engine.  (This time the language was just for procedurally generated art, so it was a little more justified.) | Lots of churn on world generation systems.  Created a level editor. | Still spending more time on the engine than the game.        |
| 2021        | Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 2021 | Experimented with working on the game in parallel with both engines to see which would rise to the top. | With their gradual improvements, my familiarity warts, and my growing desperation, I was starting to feel more at home with these tools. | More focus on world building and setting prototyping         | I love open source, and I've always struggled with using proprietary game engines. |
| 2021        | Godot 3                        | Godot is open source.                                        | Godot's maintainers are figuring out how to make a game engine as they go.  The current iteration is a heavily marketed learning exercise. | Created a full alpha game that I've played a fair amount with my sons. | I like Godot for what it will be instead of what it is, and it will be a long time before it can support a serious 3D game. |
| 2022        | Unreal Engine 4                | I just need a professional,  battle-tested solution, and at this point it's a razer-edge gap between Unreal and Unity. | I've still experimented with switching to Unity in the midst of this. | Close to finishing an alpha game.                            | There are days when I want to demolish Unreal with a baseball bat, but it looks like I may have finally settled. :crossed_fingers: |

## Epilogue

In retrospect, I do wish I had stuck with either Unreal or Unity and shipped a game by now, but that is a small regret.  The lessons learned are nearly worth the opportunity cost.
