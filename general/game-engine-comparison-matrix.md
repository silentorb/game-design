# Game Engine Comparison Matrix

This comparison matrix was created to aid selection of an engine for developing the Marloth game. The criteria and ratings of this comparison are specialized toward that goal (a first person 3D role playing game created by one person), but this document may have some general value for other projects.

GZDoom may seem like an odd option, but it is an impressive technology with a large community and is increasingly powering hit 3D indie games.

## Notes

### No subscriptions

* The [revenue caps on Unity subscriptions](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software) are a little dubious:
  * The caps are based on all income regardless of whether the income is related to Unity or gaming
  * For contractors, the revenue cap is dictated by the *client's* income, meaning that if a developer is providing free Unity services to a corporation, that developer would need to pay for the Pro Unity subscription ($1,800 per year as of mid 2022)
  * Technically, Unity's usage restrictions have nothing to do with whether a game is published—many people on the internet falsely claim that Unity is free for everyone to experiment with, but Unity's legal documents and representatives have made it clear that is not the case—there are many cases where it is illegal for a user to install and run the Unity editor without first paying for a subscription
    * This is not legal advice, but it is probable that Unity can only practically enforce their terms when there is a published game
* In essence, Unity's terms discourage contractors and agencies who only dabble with Unity
* Conversely, Unity's terms prefer customers who are either pure hobbyists or dedicated game developers

### Targets Senior Developers

* The foundation of Unity's architecture was overly targeted toward amateur programmers
  * Unity could have been designed out of the gate with an advanced lower level and an easier higher level, but instead it had a single easy level, resulting in the original Unity being a toy instead of a serious developer tool
    * This initial architecture direction probably did not save time in reaching market, but instead would have led to a codebase that tripped over itself
* Unity has been gradually remedying this amateur foundation over the past decade but there is still a lot of legacy residue

### Elegant Programming

* Unreal's programming has the following issues:
  * Extremely inefficient C++ compile times
    * Beefy hardware can help with this but only to a point, and it shouldn't be needed
    * Contrary to what many Unreal developers say, the issue is not that the Unreal codebase is large—the problem is with UBT
      * Incremental C++ builds are a solved problem—Unreal bypasses much industry standard tooling in favor of their incomplete custom tooling that doesn't have proper incremental build support
  * The majority of C++ code needs to be parsed by UBT, which only supports a narrow subset of C++ features and forces some unprofessional programming practices
  * Even though C++ is Unreal's foundation, many of Unreal's systems (Such as it's UI, AI, and skeletal animation) treat C++ as a second-rate citizen (in favor of Blueprints)
  * For an experienced developer, blueprints take more time to create and maintain than code, are more limited in their ability to abstract common patterns, and are more limited in terms of refactoring, debugging, and profiling
  * In practice, most Unreal games need to split their codebase between C++ and Blueprints, which generally means increased shuffling of functionality back and forth between the two domains and increased code rewriting
  * The Unreal codebase has many legacy design decisions from the 90s, such as:
    * Requiring developers to prefix classes with letter symbols
    * A [non-standard coordinate system](https://www.techarthub.com/wp-content/uploads/coordinate-comparison-chart-full.jpg)
      * Which is non-standard because it frankly doesn't make a lot of sense
        * Having X+ be the forward axis might make sense considering that X+ *is* the starting point for cartesian rotations except Unreal's Y axis is backwards for that to be useful
        * At least Unreal uses Z-up :thumbsup:

### Code separate from assets

* While there are cases where it can be convenient to treat some code as game assets, Unity's treatment of the entire codebase as a collection of game assets sacrifices many professional programming features and introduces additional workflow challenges and workflow performance challenges

### Integrated 3D game framework

* A similar framework can be built in other engines, but out-of-the-box, the Unreal game systems are so polished and mature (particularly their character and camera rigs), it is difficult to recreate that same level of quality elsewhere
* Likewise, DOOM's gameplay systems have an extremely polished and definitive feel that has been an industry reference point for decades

### Minimal editor pauses

* Unity can suffer from severe editor pauses unless the code is well organized (divided into assemblies) and the relatively recent feature of skipping domain reloading when playing is turned on

### Component system

* Godot's node-based system is inferior to a more traditional component system
  * Unreal and Unity's component systems work great for 90% of use cases and are terrible for the remaining 10%
  * Godot's node system is convoluted for 90% of use cases, and great for the remaining 10%

### Robust level creation

#### Unreal

* The official way to create levels in Unreal is to prototype with BSP brushes and then replace all of that with static meshes
* Unreal's BSP tools are old and minimally maintained
* BSP could be used for runtime but it is not optimized for that
* Static meshes are great for detail but don't lend themselves well to seamless, organic architecture
* Unreal recently added integrated static mesh editing tools, but at least for now they have very limited texturing features which makes them effectively useless for serious level creation
* With Unreal 5.0 the engine is transitioning toward procedurally generating static meshes, which is a game changer and head-and-shoulders above any competition.  However, outside of the [Lyra sample project](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-geometry-tools-in-unreal-engine/) there is not much documentation or adoption for this approach yet.

#### Unity

* Unity has both Probuilder and Realtime CSG, both of which support agile prototyping and optimized runtime
* Each of these tools supports much more organic level geometry than simply using static meshes
* Using either tools make it easier to perform massive changes to finished levels without extensive rework
* Realtime CSG is not officially supported by Unity and it is tricky for its maintainers to keep it fully compatible with all major version of Unity

### Robust profiling tools

* Unity's profiling tools are adequate—Unreal's profiling tools are impressive

### Up front technical costs

* Unity has a tendency to be full of technical surprises that don't surface until late into production

### Easy editor installation
